Three months ago, I had an interesting business trip to Japan with my team. It was my first time traveling for work. On Saturday night, around 9 PM, we met at Tan Son Nhat Airport to check in. Although I had been to Tan Son Nhat many times before, this was my first time entering the international terminal. It was more modern than the domestic one.

We arrived in Japan at 6 AM local time after a safe flight. We were all so excited to experience everything Japan had to offer. We had booked a hotel for a 7-day stay. First, we went to the hotel to rest before heading out to explore and try some Japanese food.

On the second day, we visited the head office, which was much larger and more beautiful than I had imagined. We were warmly welcomed by our Japanese colleagues, who were incredibly friendly. During the weekdays, we worked at the office during regular hours and had lunch with our Japanese colleagues. One night, they even organized a welcome party for us, which was very exciting and fun.

The day before we returned to Vietnam, Imu-san, a friendly colleague, guided us around some iconic places in Tokyo, such as Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Park. We also visited a supermarket to buy souvenirs and Japanese items as gifts for our families.

Finally, we returned to Vietnam with many memorable experiences. I was very impressed by how modern Japan is, especially the subway system, which we used to travel to most places. I also really enjoyed the beautiful sights and took many photos with my team.

Overall, it was a memorable trip.
