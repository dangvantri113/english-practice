It took place several months ago. When I was sitting in a café, I saw Mr.Hung come with a stranger. I was about to approach him to say hello, but they were in a conversation, so I thought I should leave them alone. Suddenly, I heard about some secret information of the new product of my company. He exposed our business to the competitor. I was disappointed in him, I didn't think he could do that. I tried to keep calm and thought about what I should do. Then, I turned on my phone and recorded their conversation. I also wore a face mask and turned my head to another side to make sure he didn't notice me. About 15 minutes later, they left the café. I kept the recordings for hours before making a call to him about the corruption. I expressed my disappointment and asked him for the reason. He told me about his financial problem and begged me to keep the secret. However, I disagreed completely, and I asked him to tell the truth to the manager tomorrow. He agreed and apologized to me. Fortunately, there was no serious damage was done.
