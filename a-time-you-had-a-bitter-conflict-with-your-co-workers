A few months ago, I had a bitter conflict with my teamate. It was about how to improve quality of our product. While she believed that we needed to develop and test more carefully, I prefered to give the value of our product as soon as possible and make improvements after that. We argued seriously about it a lot of hours. I didn't want to lose at all and tried my best to protect my points. However, a few days later, I found her points was  vital in some situations. I agreed that developing and testing carefully were necessary to raise customers' belief to our products. She also undertood my concern about taking time for developing and testing, so she suggested that we could create a quick check list to decrease the time. Finally, we were on the same page.
