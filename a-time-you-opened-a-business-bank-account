Last year, I opened a business bank account at BIDV bank. It was the first time I opened a business bank account, so I took a lot of time before choosing BIDV Bank. I shopped around to see which bank was the most attractive benefit as well as the lowest fee. I found some banks, but BIDV was the most reputed so I chose it. Then, I went there with an EIN and a business license. Once I entered the office, the staff welcomed me and directed me carefully. Next, a banker showed me the benefits and fees when opening an account and helped me open one. Everything was smooth and quick, just in 30 minutes, I had my own business bank account. So far, I still use it in my business and it helps me a lot in accepting transactions from my customers.
