To be honest, I'm usually worried about that. But I think it's an interesting challenge. It is also a chance for me to make progressive. In addition, If I deal with the problem well, I could be promoted to a higher position. So, I hardly avoid the issue. I like to deal with it. I am going to plan carefully and make sure that nothing can make me interrupt. A lot of things are sometimes harder than I think. However, all companies are willing to help me pass over it. It's not only really helpful but also makes our relationship tight. In short, I am willing to deal with the problem because I want to challenge myself and I believe that my companies are always willing to help me.
