As a person working far from home, I have had many flights. 
Almost flights have been safe and fight attendants have been really polite and friendly. 
But, I have ever read a paper about bad behaviours of Jesta attendants. 
It was about five years ago. 
Passengers were Vietnam football young players who won a champion. 
To celebrate them, Jesta had dancers make a party with sexy atmosphere in the flight. 
That was very not suitable because player was so young. 
This behaviour was also not fit to the culture of Vietnam. 
Many people said Jesta just tried to PR for their's brand. 
But they made a mistake, people didn't like that. 
So their business got a down trend. 
It's a good lesson for Jesta and others agents.
