As someone who frequently travels by air for work, Iâ€™ve had many flights. Most of them have been safe, with flight attendants who are polite and friendly. However, I once read an article about inappropriate behavior by Jesta Airlines' attendants about five years ago. The passengers were young Vietnamese football players who had just won a championship. To celebrate, Jesta organized an in-flight party with dancers, creating a highly inappropriate and "sexy" atmosphere, especially considering the age of the players. This act was not only unsuitable for the young athletes but also clashed with Vietnamese cultural values. Many people criticized Jesta, accusing them of using the event as a PR stunt to promote their brand. Unfortunately, it backfired, as the public disliked the approach, leading to a downturn in their business. It serves as a valuable lesson for Jesta and other companies.
