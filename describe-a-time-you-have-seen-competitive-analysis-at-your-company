To be honest, my work isn't usually relevant to competitive analysis, so I don't often attend meetings about that. However, recently I have participated in a big meeting for all staff an heard a report about competitors.
Although it's a long speech about too many factors to remember, I'm impressed with two important things. First, all our competitors are big technology companies, such as Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, etc. These companies have many product lines, one of them is software for working as a team, which is a primary product line of my company. The second thing that I found interesting is how the strategy to compete with these corporations. The manager planned a detailed strategy for a long time with a lot of milestones and analyzed competitors' weaknesses as well as our strengths. Therefore, everyone felt confident to continue working effectively.
