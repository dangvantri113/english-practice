I think through opening a coffee shop. I usually go to coffee shops to read books and work. Thanks to the peaceful atmosphere at these cafes, I can focus on work and increase productivity. 
I also want everyone to experience these feelings, so I will open a coffee shop someday. However, it's not easy because there are a lot of cafes outside. I must compete with strong and famous brands not only from Vietnam but also all over the world such as Star Buck, Highland, etc.
Despite these difficulties, I believe I will succeed if I have a good strategy and implement it step by step. Anyway, it will be a pretty far future when I have enough experience and a big fund.
