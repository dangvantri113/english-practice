To be honest, I don't like presenting a product in front of customers. I'm not good at it. Moreover, I usually get a lot of problems when they ask questions. 
They usually compare my product with others. Which makes me feel they aren't open to my present. And then they continue to ask other questions. Some of them are so silly that I think they don't know anything about what I presented for long hours. Then I don't feel excited anymore. I prefer to give ideas or products to colleagues because they really understand what I say and what the ideas or products can bring. Anyway, it's not good to have bad behavior with customers, so I shouldn't be a marketer or a salesman.
