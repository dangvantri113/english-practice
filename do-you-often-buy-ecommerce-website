Certainly, I am a big fan of e-commerce. I usually buy clothing on Shopee which is the most reputable ecommerce platform in Vietnam and purchase movie tickets on CGV's website. I also like browsing for unique or unusual items, even when I have no plan to buy anything. Actually, e-commerce makes my life more convenient because it has many advantages. Firstly, it operates all the time, so I can order whenever I have spare time. Instead of waiting until the morning to buy a new jean, I can order at night and the shipper will bring it to my company in the following morning. In addition, there's a wide range of products from all over the world on the Internet. It's wonderful when I can buy a hi-tech product from any nation such as Japan, Germany, etc. In short, I'm sure that e-commerce as well as Internet are really vital in modern life.
