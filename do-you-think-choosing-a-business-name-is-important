Of course, I will choose an entity name because it identifies your brand and protects you from people who intend to fake your business. A good business name can make customers think about your products immediately. In addition, it's a good way to show the belief and the power you want to pass to customers. Legally, an entity name will also help you avoid fakers. If you don't make a registration in your state, other people can do business under the same name, which is extremely terrible because your liability would be badly affected.
