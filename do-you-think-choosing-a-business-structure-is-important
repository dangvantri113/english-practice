Certainly because the structure not only affects the tax you have to pay but also increase your liability. In addition, you should choose a type which is suitable for your product and your business scale. For example, if you open a coffee store, a sole proprietorship is a good choice while if you open a business around the world, a corporation is more reasonable. Personally, I am going to manufacture and sell computers, so I am going to open a limited liability for that business. I think that business structure is enough liable for my potential customers and it easily extends to the corporation when my business grows strongly.
