I think it is up to who you entertain. It much easier to entertain people I understand more than people I don't know so much.  
For example, if I entertain my close friends It will be easy to make a plan. I know everything they like, where they want to go,... So I'm absolutely to make a suceessful party or an interesting trip. 
However, it take much harder when I have to entertain an customer. I may know a little about him thanks to his profile or a few short talkings. So, I will wonder if he likes the restaurant I book, if he feels interested in my questions,..
Anyway, I think if I have more chances to entertain customers I will familiar with that. Then, I will find that it's not too hard to entertain anyone.
