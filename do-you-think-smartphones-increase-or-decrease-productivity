In my opinion, smartphones decrease productivity significantly. There are several reasons for this situation. Firstly, we spend hours on scrolling through our phones while they are not related to our work. For example, we browse social media or watch videos during working time. As a result, we really just spend a few hours on work. Secondly, the notifications from mobile phones often distract our focus. It's awful to be interrupted when we are focusing on handling a complex problem. In that situation, we can mistake easily and sometimes we must start again. In conclusion, using smartphones makes us distracted and poor productivity.
