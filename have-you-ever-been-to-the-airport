Yes, I have. I often fly from HCM City on vacations. 
So I am quite familiar with being at Tan Son Nhat airport. 
It is the biggest airport in Vietnam. There are two terminals. 
I have been at the Domestic many times while I have just been at the International once. 
There are many people here. 
They are often so busy and hurry.
Flight attendants work very hard to make sure everyone flies in time. 
Sometimes, they must look for people who come late.
Despite working hard, they are friendly and willing to help passengers.
I love them so much because they make my vacations fluent and happy.
