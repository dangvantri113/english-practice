Yes, I have booked a single room before in a small hotel early this year. It was located in a small town next to Tokyo. Although it was not large, I was satisfied with its convenience. There was a store near the hotel, so I could buy necessary things. Every morning, I had breakfast on the second floor before going to work. It took only 5 minutes from the hotel to my company by subway. I also felt comfortable in the room because it was so peaceful. It made me sleep well. I loved that hotel. I stayed a week and enjoyed my trip there.
