Yes, I have bought an emergency ticket. 
It was about early this year. 
I remembered that I booked a ticket to HCM for work. 
Unfortunately, I found I had mistaken booking on the day before departure.
The ticket was from HCM to my home town.
Immediately, I called Vietnam Airlines to buy an emergency ticket.
Although I tried to get the cheapest ticket, I paid twice more than normal.
Anyway, I arrived HCM on time and was satisfied with the flight.
