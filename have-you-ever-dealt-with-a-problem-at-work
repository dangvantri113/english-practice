Of course, yes. I have dealt with a lot of problems at work. They were about my tasks, managers, and colleagues. Last month, I was assigned a very difficult task of drawing a large graph on my web application. I had to find a solution as soon as possible. During a week I tried a lot of approaches but was not successful. However, I didn't give it up and tried another. Fortunately, it worked. I was really happy about that. Finally, I could sleep tight after a hard week.
