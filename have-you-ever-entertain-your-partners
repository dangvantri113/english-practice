Yes, certainly. Recently, I entertained a friend at my home. His name is Tuong. We studied together in a class when we were students in university.
He just arrived in HCM city because of his new job. So I invited him to my home and entertained him with drinks to welcome him to HCM city. 
We drank beers, ate pork and seafood. We talked about health, work, football, music everything in life unitl late. We stopped talking and went to bed. 
After a good sleep, he went home and arrived safely. It was great to meet him again after a long time.
