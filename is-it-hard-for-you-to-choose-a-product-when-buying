It's quite easy for me to choose a product. I just buy something necessary. I also list a few points before deciding to buy. At first, I will check how much I can afford. It's not smart to buy new expensive clothes or shoes and then live a month without money. Next, I will look for where I can buy it. The store doesn't need to be large or famous as long as I know it well. Last but not least, I will require a guarantee for it. If there's any issue I can take another or be helped easily. Sometimes, I have difficulty buying a gift for someone because I'm not sure what she likes.
