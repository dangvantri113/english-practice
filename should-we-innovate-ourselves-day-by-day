I think we shouldn't. For example, we don't need to gain a higher score or achieve a new success every day. Chasing success can make us tired and stressed. Therefore, we sometimes should be completely relaxed. We can stop trying on some days and lie straight on our beds. To relax and rest in the right ways not only recharges our energy, but also allows us to prepare better for the future. In modern life, we often hear the story of someone's success on social media. It encourages us, but it makes us stressed because we don't want to be behind. We then try to innovate ourselves day by day and chase money, success, higher positions, etc. However, we forget to relax and love ourselves. This is very harmful because it can result in issues with our health.  In summary, we should innovate ourselves wisely and don't forget to spend time on entertainment.
