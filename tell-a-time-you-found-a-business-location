Last month, while I was looking for a place to locate my new coffee store, by a chance, I went through such a beautiful area. Immediately, I found that it was an ideal business location. The first reason was it was quite near the center of city. It just took 5 minutes to get there from the center, so it would be accessed easily by potential customers. In addition, the lanscape around there was extremely attractive and bright. I was confident that people would feel comfortable and satisfied when tasting my delicious coffee next to such space.
