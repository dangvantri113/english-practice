I love helping everyone, so I usually lend my friends money. Last month, Mr.Trang, an university friend, was planning to build his house but he lacked some money, so he called me to brow. Knowing how the amount of money was vital to him, I was willing to lend him. I also wished him a beautiful house and promised to visit it as soon as possible. Then, he told me that he was thankful to me and promised he would return the money to me by June of next year. I was really happy because I helped my friend handle an important issue.
