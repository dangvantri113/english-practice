Last week, I made an annual leave request for my sister’s wedding. 
I wrote a message to my manager to ask him If I could take a day off on Friday. 
In the message, I expressed the importance for me to attend this wedding. 
It was an opportunity to show my love for my sister as well as my family. 
Besides that, I told him that I had Mr.Hai take care of my work during my absence, so he didn’t worry about that. 
At the end of the message, I told him that I appreciated if he had accepted my request. 
About an hour after I sent the message, he accepted my request and wished me a relaxed and joyful party.
