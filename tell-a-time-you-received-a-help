I'm lucky to have friendly collegues, who are always willing to give me a hand whenever I need support. Last week, I had to leave the office early because I was feeling sick, but I didn't complete my work. Fortunately, Mr.Anh recognized my issue and he advised me to take care the health. Moreover, he gave me a hand to complete the work quickly and I could leave the office without any worries. I was really thankful to him for that, so I invited him for some coffee on the next day. It's great to work with such collegues like him.
