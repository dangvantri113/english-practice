There are many different banks in Vietnam such as Agribank, Vietcombank, etc, but I often use BIDV for serveral reasons. First, it's very well known in Vietnam, so I believe that it's extremely safe to make transactions. Also, it has a lot of branches in my country and I can access it easily despite where I am. When I go to a branch, I'm always welcome and the staff serves me carefully. Last but not least, when I was an intern of the first company I worked for, BIDV and my old company cooperated to create an account for me. I used it since that time and always feel comfortable, so I'm sure that I will keep that for a long time.
