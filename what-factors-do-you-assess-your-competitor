There are several factors I have to assess when analyzing competitors such as market share, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities to enter the market, etc. However, the points I usually focus on most are the strengths and weaknesses of competitors because of two main reasons. First, it's crucial to learn from the successes of other companies as well as avoid their failures. In this way, I can reduce risks in the next business and approach the market in the right way. The second reason is that I also planned to avoid their strengths and focus on their weaknesses. For example, my competitors are strong in the product line of headphones but not good in earphones, so I should focus on producing earphones instead of headphones. In short, you must know your competitors' strengths and weaknesses if you want to succeed in your business.
