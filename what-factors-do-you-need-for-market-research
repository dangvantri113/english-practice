There are several factors you need to investigate carefully to make sure your market research will be successful such as demand, market size, location, etc. All of them are important in different ways, but personally, demand is most important for some reasons. First of all, demand is crucial to decide what product or service should be developed, in other words, there's no product created until someone needs it. In addition, identifying whether people's needs are high or low is very useful for making a strategy for business. For example, if the demand for product A is higher than for product B, the company should focus on developing product A while keeping the other at a lower level. In general, let's research people's demands seriously, otherwise, you will fail in your business.
