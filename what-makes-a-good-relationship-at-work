In order to build a positive relationship at work, we need to address three crucial things. First and foremost, we must respect each other. We always want to be respected, especially in the workplace. Therefore, expressing respect to others is key to a relationship. Moreover, we need to care about and show concern for our colleagues. It's wonderful to receive help when we face a tough task, as well as encouragement when we are tired. Last but not least, we need to be honest in our communication and behavior. Clearly, this will build trust in each other and make our relationship stronger. In general, respect, care, and honesty are principles to build a good relationship at work.
