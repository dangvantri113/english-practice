what product do you usually buy for yourself?
I live alone in Ho Chi Minh City, far from my family, so I have to cook for myself. That's why I usually go to the market and buy food now weekends.
I typically buy meat, vegetables, fruits, milk, and other essentials. When selecting these items, I often check if they are still fresh or have not passed their expiry date.
In addition, I only buy from a few familiar stores that I trust.
Anyway, I believe I'm pretty smart when it comes to choosing ingredients.
