During three years at the company, I made many suggestions for new staff, the hiring process, etc. The best memorable suggestion was about three months ago. 
We were planning a new project and had trouble finding an open-source library for drawing charts on screens. Then, I thought through that and found some compatible libraries. Next, I asked the project manager for two days to investigate further. During that time, I analyzed the strengths and drawbacks of each library before choosing the best candidate. Next, I wrote a detailed analysis and presented it to my team. Finally, the candidate that I suggested was chosen officially, and I was satisfied absolutely with it. Suggestions are not only always helpful to people, but they are also important to enhance your quality. It's the reason why we should give people good advice as possible.
