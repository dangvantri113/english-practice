Personally, there are a lot of things, but I would like to talk about three main steps I have to take to find a good market for my service. First of all, I need to understand my product and what value it can bring to customers. It's essential to find the right market before expecting to find out a good one. Next, I will evaluate the market with specific sides to identify the target customers, whether it is the young or the old, the rich or the poor, men or women, etc. Finally, I will evaluate each market carefully by considering the size, the potential profit, etc before deciding which is the most appropriate market for my business. After winning in this market, I will expand the business to others.
