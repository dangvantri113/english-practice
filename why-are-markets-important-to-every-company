It's simple the companies cannot exist without the markets. The companies need money for operations such as renting offices, paying for staff, and so on. Where is the money the companies can get? It's the markets.
The companies provide their products to the markets and receive profits. Thanks to the profits, the companies pay for staff, purchase offices, as well as have the budget to make new products.
Most companies want to expand their markets because the larger the companies are the greater the profits are received. 
For example, one of the reasons why the profit of Amazon Corporation was the greatest in 2023 was its market was all people over the world.
In brief, the markets are crucial to the companies.
