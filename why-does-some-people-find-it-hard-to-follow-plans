There are several reasons that make us find it hard to follow our plans, despite the plans seeming perfect. Firstly, we are usually interrupted by noise, other people, the weather, etc. These things are common and inevitable because they exist everywhere, surrounding us. Therefore, we should stay calm and return to our work if any distraction annoys you. Secondly, we usually forget to prioritize our tasks. Sometimes, we spend too much time on irrelevant tasks while just a little on more significant ones. This decreases our productivity and breaks the plans. Last but not least, we don't divide the big plan into specific targets. If we don't have the small specific targets, we easily get lost and lack trust in the big plans. For example, we have a 2-year plan without any milestones. I am sure that you will get depressed because you don't complete any goals for a long time. To summarize, there are many reasons that make plans broken, but you can overcome these challenges completely.
