During my three years at the company, I have made many suggestions, mainly related to projects and working processes. The most memorable suggestion was made about two years ago. While fixing an issue with the product, I realized that we lacked a policy for categorizing issues. This made the system difficult to track and maintain. Immediately, I discussed this necessity with my team members, and they all agreed with me.

Afterward, I drafted a proposal and presented it to other teams. Unfortunately, many people persited that categorizing issues would be too complicated and time-consuming. As a result, the meeting lasted several hours but ended without a resolution, and the discussion was postponed to another meeting.

In subsequent meetings, we invited some experts and asked for their advice on the benefits and drawbacks of building a system to classify issues. Thanks to the helpful advice from the experts, everyone recognized the importance of such a system and started working on it.

Now, every issue is appropriately categorized, which has proven to be very useful for maintaining the current product and expanding to new ones. I am proud of the positive changes that resulted from my suggestion.
