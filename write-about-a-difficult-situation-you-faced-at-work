Last week was very difficult for me. I was assigned a tough task and slept on it. However, I didn't handle it and just kept everything in my mind. I really avoided making a decision on it because I felt unsure of my solution, and it seemed not to fix the problem completely. I delayed reporting my solution to my manager. As a result, I was not ready when the deadline was coming. However, I tried to manage my task and reported it on the last due day. Although I met the deadline, I felt disappointed with the quality of my solution, the delay, and the negative impact it had on my teammates. I should have shared my thoughts with them earlier. They could have helped me a lot to find better solutions.
