I have been operating an online business on Shoppee since last year. The registration process on this e-commerce platform was so simple and quick that it took only about an hour for my shop to be under operation. So far, my business has been gradually growing which makes me very happy. It is thanks to the convenience of e-commerce. In fact, the Internet makes my product accessible to my potential customers. Also, my product can be transferred to any city in Vietnam because Shoppee has a lot of branches. In years to come, I hope my business keeps developing and provides more value to my customers.
